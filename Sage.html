  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. "Grim" Wall</h2>
  <img src="images/Sagegrimwall.JPG" <br>
    <p> Using a Barrier Orb, you can jump on it to get elevation. In this example, the person placed the wall on a ledge so that the wall would float mid-air.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Double Ressurection</h2>
  <img src="images/Sagedoublerevive.JPG" <br>
    <p> If you ressurect someone at the very start of the round, get all the ultimate orbs scattered in the map, get all kills, and plant the spike, it is theoretically possible to ressurect another person in the same round.</p>
