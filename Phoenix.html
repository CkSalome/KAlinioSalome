  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Wall flash</h2>
  <img src="images/PhoenixWallFlash.png"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> Using the Blaze utility you can obstruct your enemy's vision and information on your team's standing. This makes it hard for them to push thru it. The flashes of Phoenix or the Curveball can go thru his walls, combined with the wall to obstruct vision you can do un unexpected flash and push thru without much consequences.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Hot Hands heal</h2>
  <img src="images/PhoenixMollyHeal.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> While the Hot Hands ability can damage enemies, it can also be of heal to your own. The Phoenix "molly heal" can make you heal 60HP in a quick amount of time giving you an edge to re-engage enemies for multifrags.</p>
