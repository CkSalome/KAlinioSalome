  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Incendiary Line ups</h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneMolly.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> The Incendiary is a molotov like ability that has a double bounce before landing. You can take this into a post plant to keep defusers away by making the ground of the spike unreachable because of the molotov damage. You could also sometimes just throw it in the air so that it has delay but it only works when the enemy has barely any time.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. No smoke cover diffuse</h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneUlt.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> A little fact about the orbital strike is that it does less damage at the sides of the circle. If you half the defuse and ult yourself on the side while defusing, the enemy will mostlikely be confused and won't try to swing you giving you a free half of the defuse. </p>
