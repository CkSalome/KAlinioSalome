  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. One way Smokes</h2>

  <p> The visual point of the eye is much greater when further from a wall. This can be exploited by putting a smoke on a wall on a door way of a hallway to obscure their eyevision while being able to see their legs. This gives you the advantage on defensive side but it's rarely used for attack or retake.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Ninja Entry</h2>
  <img src="yoru/Yoruclonepicks.jpg" height="270px" width="480px" <br>
  <p> Due to omen's tp allowing him for different elevations, His tp can allow him to take off angles by tping up boxes or any other things. This can be further taken advantage of when smoking or double smoking obscuring enemies of the information making them more weary and paranoid everytime. </p>
