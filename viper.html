  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Snake bite Line ups</h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneMolly.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> The snake bite paired with the poison orb can decay your enemy to 1hp while finishing them off. The molly has same trajectory as a brimstone molly so learning brim line ups might be similar.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Shorty Ult</h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneUlt.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> Using a shorty when in ult can have a good impact as staying longer in the ult can decay you to 1hp and the short visual makes it perfect for a shorty. </p>
