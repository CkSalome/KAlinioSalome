  <h1> Cosmic Divide </h1> <br>

  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Pulling them in!</h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneMolly.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> The Gravity Well can help alot on post plant, This can pull enemies when defusing out into the open and this will achieve two things, put them in a vulnerable position and stop them from defusing.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Astral Hide </h2>
  <img src="images/BrimstoneUlt.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> In astra's astral form her legs get pulled up. This can be very sneaky, place a smoke on a box where the feet can be seen. Smoke it off and go into astral form when the eneies enter site as they wont check it. You have easy frags after they get set up as they wont reclear it. </p>
