    ALTERNATE FIRE to throw all remaining daggers but does not recharge on a kill. <br> <br> </p>


  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Super Updraft</h2>
  <img src="images/JettSuperUpdraft.jpg" height="270px" width="480px" <br>
  <p> There are certain spots on the maps in valorant where you could updraft and lift up jett 5x the updraft range for
    the cost of a single utility. This is very over powered if combined with her ult because it will throw off people's
    crosshair placement while having a great aerial view of the map. (The super updraft is mainly in icebox)</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Smoke Dash</h2>
  <img src="images/JettSmokeDash.jpg" height="270px" width="480px" <br>
  <p> Jett has smokes that lasts 4 seconds, making door way smokes for this would be mostly a waste. Instead you'd want
    to dash into a crucial part of a site or site entry way and look both sides while dashing to clear the corners, you
    can reangage after awhile creating space for your team.</p>
