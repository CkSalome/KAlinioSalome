  <h2>1. Ground Pop flash</h2>
  <img src="yoru/Yorugroundflash.jpg" height="270px" width="480px" <br>
  <p> A yoru flash reaches higher above your head when you pop it to the ground. This can extremely help on one way flashing when on your Ultimate as they can't see you so you can get close to them then pop out get free picks. Another way is waiting behind on radianite boxes as it's a perfect height for a one way flash just don't forget flashes are based on contact so even if you don't get flashed make sure to cover as much space for a flash.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Clone Picks</h2>

  <p> A yoru clone is commonly not used to its full potential. Pre setting your clone to the opposite side and peeking off of it can make your enemies blind or make it harder to aim for you as they need to flick. you can also do this going out of your ult to get a higher chance of a pick with less risk. generating sounds with your clone can misdirect your enemy on where you are as well making them doubt where you are next time you clone out. </p>
