  <h1>Tricks</h1> <br>
  <h2>1. Recon Bolt Lineups</h2>
  <img src="images/Sovalineup.jpg"height="270px" width="480px" <br>
    <p> With practice and research, a person can use the recon bolt to make it land somewhere at a designated spot either near or even very far away to gather player information. Like in the example, you shoot the recon bolt at the position with the specific amount of charges and bounces.</p> <br>

  <h2>2. Double Shock Bolt</h2>
  <img src="images/Sovadoubleshockbolt.JPG"height="270px" width="360px" <br>
    <p> This is basically the same concept as trick 1. However, instead you shoot 2 bolts that should land at the same spot AT THE SAME TIME. If pulled correctly, you can deal upto 150 damage which is an instakill even with shields on.</p>
